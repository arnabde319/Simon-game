# Simon-Game
Play a game of Simon.

Demo link: https://arnabde319.github.io/Simon-game/

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Current functionalities include:

* A sound and "light up" animation that corresponds to each button plays both when the series of button presses plays, and when the player personally presses a button.
* If the player presses wrong button then the game is over and the game asks if he/she wants to restart
* Win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.!

Here is a sneakpeak from the game!
